From the following figure, we see that there is a high level of variation at the individual patient level.\n\n# Sample 50 random id's\nsample_ids &lt;- sample(covid_phq$ID, 50)\n# Plot\nxyplot(PHQ ~ time | ID, \n       data= covid_phq[covid_phq$ID %in% sample_ids, ], \n       panel=function(x,y){\n         panel.xyplot(x, y, type = c(\"l\", \"p\"))\n       }, ylim=c(-1, 28), as.table=T)\n\n\n\n\nWe can then plot a spaghetti plot stratified by the three different age groups.\n\ncovid_phq %&gt;% group_by(time, AGE) %&gt;% \n  mutate(mean= mean(PHQ), sd= sd(PHQ)) %&gt;% \n  ungroup() %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x= time, y= PHQ, group = ID)) + \n  geom_line(alpha = 0.1) + \n  geom_point(alpha = 0.1, shape = 21) +\n  facet_grid(. ~ AGE) + \n  xlab(\"Month\") + ylab(\"PHQ-9 Score\") +\n stat_summary(fun=mean,geom=\"line\",lwd= 2,aes(group=1),  colour = \"blue\") +\n  geom_linerange(alpha=0.03, mapping=aes(x=time, ymin=mean-sd, ymax=mean+sd), color=\"blue\")+\n  theme(axis.title.y=element_blank()) + theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nWe do see a slight increasing trend of PHQ-9 scores over the three months in the young adult age-group (20-39) compared to the other two age-groups.\nNext we can look at the relationship between the demographic variables and PHQ.\n\ntarget_variables &lt;- names(covid_phq[, c(4:11)])\nmy_plots_list &lt;- lapply(target_variables, function(each_variable) {\nggplot(covid_phq, aes_string(each_variable, \"PHQ\"))  + geom_boxplot() + theme_bw()\n})\n\ngridExtra::grid.arrange(grobs = my_plots_list)\n\n\n\n\nAlthough there are a lot of points beyond the quantile + IQR range, we do see some tentative trends: married people seem to have a relatively lower PHQ score, there may be a decreasing trend in PHQ score with an increase in Household income. A negative economic impact (2) also seems to have a higher PHQ score compared to the other two categories. Perhaps only residential areas seems like it may not have an impact on the PHQ score.\nFinally we can look at the relationship between the item score variables and PHQ over time for 4 of the scale items (Humor, Substanceuse, Venting, and Anger Control). I did not take the time to code this more elegantly, and so generated one plot from one ggplot call instead of looping over the variables as I should have. I have the code for one variable displayed below and the final call to grid.arrange.\n\n# Substance use\nlong1_Substanceuse &lt;- covid_phq %&gt;%\n  group_by(Substanceuse, time) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean = mean(PHQ), sd = sd(PHQ))\n\np1 &lt;- long1_Substanceuse  %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(factor(Substanceuse), mean, group = time, colour = time)) + geom_line() + geom_point() +\ntheme_bw() + labs(y = \"Mean PHQ Score\", x = \"Substance Use Score\", colour = \"Month\")\n\n# Arrange plots\ngrid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4,  nrow = 2, ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\nOverall, it seems as though substance score shows an increasing trend with the mean PHQ score. For both humour and venting score, either just the 3rd or both the 3rd and 6th show a decreasing trend with PHQ initially, while the PHQ score goes up again eventually in January. This is the effect of time, and averaging over time, these two scales show an overall decreasing trend. Anger Control does not necessarily seem to show any strong linear relation with the PHQ score."

Thus, the range of possible values falls between 0-27. One simple way to model these scores sticking with the traditional glm families could be to use a Poisson distribution, since we can think of the scores as aggregated counts. We could also potentially use a lognormal or a gamma distribution.\nAnother strategy is to think of each of the 27 possibilities of scores as 27 trials. A patient could thus theoretically have a chance to score a success (1) in each “trial”. This is akin to an aggregated Binomial sampling distribution, and additionally respects the bounded nature of the data in that 27 is the upper bound. Thus, we use a zero-inflated binomial model.\nWe use the {brms} package to fit a Bayesian Mixed Effects model. {brms} uses STAN as its backend, which uses the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo no-U turn sampler (HMC-NUTS). Through a Bayesian approach, we can specify weakly regularizing priors/informative priors when needed for our many coefficients since we will fit quite a few random effects and covariates. We can also obtain posterior distributions for the standard deviation of the random intercept, the coefficients of the age contrasts and so on for improved inference for our questions of interest."

For example, a \\(\\mathbb{N}(0.3,0.5)\\) prior was put on the AGE20M39 contrast because in comparison to the reference level (AGE65M79), we have reasonable knowledge to believe that there would be an overall increase in the PHQ score. Weakly regularizing \\(\\mathbb{N}(0,1)\\) priors were put on all the other coefficients for which there was no strong prior knowledge. A weakly informative student-t (3, 0, 1) prior was put on the random intercept, which is fairly permissive for large individual level variation. The z_i parameter models the proportion of zeroes, and the \\(\\text{Beta}(2, 2)\\) is again a weakly informative prior over 0 and 1 that has a slightly shifted center away from 0."

Ideally, we should have compared this full model (which is relatively over-parameterized) with a reduced model after removing coefficients in a step-wise manner through K-fold cross-validation. We can also separately model the zero-generating proportion with covariates, as well as specifically assess the young adult population to look at which coping mechanisms were successful for them in particular."
